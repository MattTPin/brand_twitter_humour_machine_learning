# brand_twitter_humour_machine_learning
This repo holds the files that were used to scrape twitter data from various brands and builds a machine learning model that can distinguish between tweets that were intended to be humorous and tweets that were not.

This was a personal project completed in January 2020. The project scrapes twitter and retrieves tweets from brands. Then builds a machine learning model based to examine tweet text and metadata to distinguish between humorous and non-humorous posts.
